# Reference based MRI Super resolution using texture transfer
Official pytorch implementation of the paper [Reference-Based Texture Transfer For Single Image Super-Resolution Of Magnetic Resonance Images](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9433961) accepted in International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2021

In this paper, we propose a reference-based, unpaired multi-contrast texture-transfer strategy for deep learning based in-plane and across-plane MRI super-resolution. 
We use the scattering transform to relate the texture features of image patches to unpaired reference image patches, and additionally a loss term for multicontrast texture.
We apply our scheme in different superresolution architectures, observing improvement in PSNR and SSIM for 4x super-resolution in most of the cases.
